🚀 After 10+ years in Full Stack development, I've come to see code as a bit like a good joke—if you have to explain it, it’s just not quite right! 😄 Along with deep expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, MERN, GoLang, and AWS, I've had the rewarding experience of leading and building teams from scratch, creating strong, dynamic groups that bring projects to life and solve tough challenges together.
