So you want to create an amazing Github profile? ðŸ¤” Well, you've come to the right place! In this article, I will show you how to create an amazing Github profile that will make you stand out from the crowd. Let's get started!

## What is Github?

Github is a website that allows you to host your code and collaborate with others. It's also a great place to showcase your work, which can be helpful when applying for jobs or internships.

## Learning Markdown

The first thing you will need to do is learn Markdown. Markdown is a markup language that allows you to format text in a way that is easy for humans to read and write. It's also the language used by Github, so it's important to learn how to use it. But don't worry! It's not as hard as it sounds. In fact, it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it.

## Contributing to Open Source

The best thing for your profile is to do some actual software contribution. But let's say that for now you don't have the time or the skills to do that. What can you do? Well the simplest thing would be to build some personal projects and host the code on Github. You are doing a course in Automation testing? Add the test suit that you've created to Github an appropriate README. What is an appropriate README? Well, let's see. Here are some excellent examples:

- [An excellent template you can use on your project](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)
- [Great pointers about how to write a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
- [A ton of actual examples of great READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

But the end of the day you want your README to convey all the needed information, but also to be easy to read and understand. So, don't be afraid to use images, gifs, and other media to make it more appealing!

## Fill in all of the relevant information

You want to make sure that you have all of the relevant information on your profile. This includes your name, location, and contact information. You should also include a link to your resume or portfolio website if you have one. If you don't have a resume or portfolio website, then it's a good idea to create one so that potential employers can learn more about you and what you do. Additionally, you should include a link to your LinkedIn profile if you have one. About other social networks - it's up to you. I personally include them them, but I don't think that it's a must.

Additionally, work on a short description that you can use a bio. This should be a short paragraph that describes who you are and what you do.

Additionally, choose an appropriate profile image - something that shows your face and is not too distracting. Avoid fitness selfies, drunk bar photos or anything of that sorts - all and all, use common sense - if the picture is not something that you want to show your potential employer, don't use it. You want to look professional and approachable.

After you've included everything you should have something like this:

## Showcasing your Projects

Now that you have a great profile, don't forget to select the repositories that you are most proud of and pin them to your profile!

Here's a simple example of how the finished product might look like:

![Pined repositories](/assets/images/creating-an-amazing-github-profile/pined-repos.png)

Also, don't forget to add a description to your pinned repositories. This will help people understand what they are looking at and why it's important! You can do that from inside the repo itself:

## Creating a Personal README

A few year ago, Github introduced a new feature - the ability to create a README for your profile. This is a great way to showcase your work and let people know what you're all about. You can use this space to talk about yourself, your interests, and what you're working on. You can also include links to your social media accounts or other websites that you want people to check out. This is a great way to show off your personality and let people know who you are.

Let's explore some awesome tools that allow use to generate some amazing personal READMES!

Or you can just do it from scratch! Be creating, have fun and show your personality!

## Creating a Portfolio Website

Do you want to go a step further? Why not create a personal website that can host you CV? Or portfolio? Blog? Or why not everything?

This very easily achievable using GitHub pages and Jekyll. My personal favorite is the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. It's easy to use, looks great and has a ton of features. You can see it in action on my personal website - [https://teodorkurtev.com/](https://teodorkurtev.com/). (a.k.a. the website you are currently on ðŸ˜†)
